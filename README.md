# Feed Reader Testing Overview
Purpose is to help developers with ability testing their code to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within application, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

# Goal for Feed Reader Testing 
Follow these testings to make sure application development doesn't break new or existing features and save time to efficient fix the code when testing the functionality.

## Who will be the tester
This is for developers start developing their application. They initially tests both pass and fail during implementing the design.

## How to play
All of tests should be passed at this point in application. A developer will manually mess up the code and test all of the functionality:

- Launch the index.html
- Break the code by doing each of the following items and run the application to observe the errors
	- Comment out a url or name
	- Remove the menu text
	- Delete an entry
	- Add extra feed to new feed selection
- Make sure to put these changes back and run application for accurately view

# Where to look for testing code
